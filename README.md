# AutoMapper
How to use:
Drag and drop the beatmap file you want remapped to the text-field, choose mode and click "Generate map".

What is AutoMapper?
AutoMapper is a program that takes an existing beatmap and gives all circles new locations.
This is true for all circles except streams and sliders.
Added feature 1: You can now choose spacing for all single taps!
Added feature 2: 2 new modes! "Inherit Spacing" and "Only Square Jumps".

Streams will just be all 1/4 notes stacked on top of each other and sliders are kept
in their original position to prevent them from going outside the screen.

What is AutoMapper good for?
AutoMapper is good for practising jumps and reading. The awkward jumps and cursor movements
are very difficult and will help you improve your aim and reading overall.
